# Author: ArenGamerZ
# Email: arendevel@gmail.com
# Version: 3.3.2-rc/stable
# Description: This is a Backup program that will help you to maintain, adminstrate and make your backup.
# Important: Set the vars below to suit your configuration, these are just an example.
# More IMPORTANT: This script is in BETA version, so report any bugs to me please
# Note: It's not mandatory to have the backup separated in another partition, but is highly recommended,
#	    because if a ransomware ciphers your disk it will also cipher your backup, thus the
#	    purpose of having a backup will become useless.
###########################################################################################################

# Full path where the backup will be stored
BkPath='/mnt/backup/'

# Full path of the location of your root data folder
DPath='/home/aren/'

# Specific directorys to backup, separated by spaces (and full path)

# Device of the backup. Use only if you want automatic mount and umount, leave empty otherwise.
Device='/dev/LinuxEncryptedData/Backup'

# Days that files will be keeped in the backup if they were removed from data folder
