####CHANGELOG V3.1.2b ####

1. Now the funcion clear is even more optimized than in version 3.0b because now it searches only the files that are older than the number you
   indicated in the variable $days, by default this variable is set up to 30.
2. Now every variable is envolved between "" to prevent shell interpreting a space as new line or another parameter.

3. Fixed a minor mistake.
