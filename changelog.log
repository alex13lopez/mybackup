#### CHANGE LOG 4.2.1-beta ####

1. Now the function clear is even more optimized than in version 3.0b because now it searches only the files that are older than the number you
   indicated in the variable $days, by default this variable is set up to 30.
2. Now every variable is between "" to prevent shell interpreting a space as new line or another parameter.

3. Fixed a minor mistake.

4. Rewritten comments, now source code is more clear

5. Added a new exception catcher on the backup() function. Now it checks if the path to backup exists

6. Rewritten function clean(), find wasn't working well, now myBackup works directly on dates. Besides, now it will delete files that were removed 30 days ago since removal from data folder, not since it was
created on backup folder (copied to backup). This was a fail of implementation, not a bug of the program, thus It wasn't detected until now.

7. Rewritten function recovery(), now it's useful. Because now you don't need to remember the name of the file you want to recover as before, now you can navigate through the backup with the CLI implemented.

8. Fixed minor type mistakes that Ivan_Blasco reported, thanks :)

9. Written a new function called device_check() that will avoid the wrong behavior the script had previously when the device of the backup wasn't mounted

10. Minor improvements:
        - Separated configuration from script so every time you update, you won't loose configuration.
        - Added '-e' option to read in recovery, so you can tabulate to autocomplete paths
        - Improved sed expression in device_check()
        - Added installer.sh, that does the job of installing and configuring for you :)
